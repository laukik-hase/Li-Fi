# Circuits & Results:

This section includes all the circuit schematics, most importantly Transimpedance Amplifier & Comparator, tried and tested on the EveryCircuit platform.

Also, some of the results, recorded in oscillscope are posted, wherein the comparison of waveforms (for. e.g. change w.r.t. distance between Tx and Rx, response of Photoodiode and LED, etc,) is visible.
